# docker-spacebarchat

Run a Spacebar server instance via docker / docker-compose.

Edit the .env file to your liking.

The postgres data is saved in a directory 'spacebar_db' where `docker compose up` was called.

You might want to run a [reverse proxy](https://docs.spacebar.chat/setup/server/reverseProxy/#nginx).
